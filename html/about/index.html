    <h1> about me </h1>
    <p>
    My name is Duarte David, and here are a few quick facts about me.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I love Computer Graphics and the broad range of subjects it encompasses!</li>
        <li>My high-level, sort of romantic end-goal is to <b>democratize art</b>! I hope to do 
            this by applying myself to research, assisting in the discovery of knowledge that allows for the creation of new tools 
            that empower artists.</li>
        <li>I really like teaching! My first taste of teaching was in the summer semester of 2020, during which I was a tutor for <b>Realistic Image Syntehsis</b>
        and <b>Image Processing and Computer Vision</b>, and it's something I really hope I have the oportunity to do again in the future!
        </li>
        <li>I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, in Portugal. I'm currently finishing my Master's Degree at the University of Saarland</li>
        <li>I've got a particular affection for movies and video games, and the stories that can be told through these media.</li>
        <li>I may have an unhealthy habit of randomly doing a half-baked implementation of a paper/siggraph-course/tweet-with-some-idea.</li>
        <li>I speak reasonably well <b>C/C++</b>, <b>WebGL</b>, <b>OpenGL</b>, I have done things with <b>Javascript</b>,<b>Rust</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Haskell</b>, <b>Java</b>,<b>CSharp</b>, <b>GLFW</b>, <b>SDL</b> and <b>SFML</b>
            I am in the process of learning <b>WebGPU</b> and <b>Vulkan</b>. I have failed miserably everytime I tried to do anything with <b>PHP</b>.</li>
        <li>When I'm not programming or doing programming adjacent things, I greatly enjoy watching and making movies and videogames!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    So now you know me a little bit better!
    </p>
     <p>
    Head on over to the <a href="http://localhost:8000/html/stuff_i_ve_made">"Stuff I've Made"</a> section of the website to see some of the 
    projects (some personal, some not) I've done over the years.
    </p>
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about Computer Graphics, I'm in the process of compiling a <a href="http://localhost:8000/html/learning_resources">series of resources</a>,
    with the hopeful thought to add my own material there at some point in the future.</p>
    <p>And finally, if you'd like to know what I do with my free time, there's a <a href="http://localhost:8000/html/more_stuff_i_ve_made?play_video=normal">hidden</a> section
    with some of my hobby projects, some of which I did in middle school, and some which are currently ongoing.</p>
