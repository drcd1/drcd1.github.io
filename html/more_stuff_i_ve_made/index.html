    <h1>hobby projects </h1>
    <h2>wasn't this hidden?...</h2>
        <p>So, sometimes I try to draw, make games or movies or something. I find it a relaxing hobby, and it also puts me in the shoes of the people who'll hopefully
         benefit from whatever it is that I manage to do professionally, as a Computer Graphics programmer</p>
        <p>Without further ado, here are some of my (forever) unfinished projects:</p>
    
        <h2>games i'll never make</h2>
        
        <h3>a game where a journalist uncovers a deep conspiracy through the art of parkour</h2>
        <p>Somewhat <del>highly derivative of</del> very influenced by <b>Beyond Good and Evil</b>, I've been toying around with 
        stylized textures and animation, and how to make the animations flow (think <b>Prince of Persia (2008)</b>). I'll probably keep making progress on this one.
        </p>

                            type="video/mp4">
                    </video>

        </div>
        <h3>a game about getting sad and stuff, but also aliens and clones</h2>
        <p>A silent hill inspired game  (low poly graphics, high quality FMVs YEAH!) where you have to climb an ever-shifting high-rise, only to find out that gooey-tentacly-aliens have invaded, and they're making copies of everyone
            for preservation! You're a copy of a copy of a copy living through hell so that they can map out your behavior in extreme situations.</p>
        <p>
        This one is probably too ambitious for me, but it's also one where the story is almost finished!
        </p>
        <div id=sad_pics>
            <img id="sad1" src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/weird_game/face.jpeg" />
            <img id="sad2" src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/weird_game/image2.png" />
            <img id="sad3" src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/weird_game/image3.png" />
            <img id="sad4" src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/weird_game/thing5.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>a game about losing your cats on an island and trying to find them</h3>
        What it says. This one should be finished at some point next year :)
        <div id=cat_pics>
            <img id="cat1" src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/other_media/cat_game.png" />
        </div>

        <h3>a game about an adventure space man looking for ancient alien batteries to fight an evil empire</h3>
        This one had various iterations. There are two versions of it: one is a metroidvania/cinematic platformer that you can see here:
        <div id=metroid_vania>
            <video muted autoplay loop id="adventure1">
                <source src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/other_media/adventure1.mp4"
                    type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <video muted autoplay loop id="adventure2">
                <source src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/other_media/adventure2.mp4"
                    type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <video muted autoplay loop id="adventure3">
                <source src="https://drcd1.github.io/resources/other_media/adventure3.mp4"
                    type="video/mp4">
            </video>
        </div>
        <p>The other is an overly ambitious 3D action game with an adventure that sprawls through an entire galaxy.
        And I actually made a very very small proof of concept for it, in 2018, with Daniel Ramos.
        Since we did this as course project, time was constrained so there was an end product... as for the quality of said product...
        </p>

        <h3>a couple more ideas for the road</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spy game called "Perfect Corps" where the the earth is governed by mega-corporations, 
                and one of them is developing an ultimate army (the so called "Perfect Corps")! You find out that the army is one made of robots, 
                and they need special batteries that were buried somewhere in the desert of Argelia by some 
                ancient advanced race, but your spy friend is one of the bad robots so he betrays you!</li>
            <li>Arcade shooter where an american adventurer whip and revolver man and a portuguese time-travelling electric guitar girl are fighting against ancient mummies 
                and nazis in lost temples
                in an island off of the pacific. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>wait, i like movies too!</h2>
        <h3>here's a kitbashed robot, made from a few photos of pipes</h3>
        <p>so this was a test to see how fast I could do something passable...
        </p>

        </video>
        
        <h3>hey look at this animation I did with digital legos</h3>
        <p>Ok, so by this point, I'm just dusting off the old hard drive. When I was 5 years old I used to make really cool animations with
         legos (using this software called <b>Lego Studios</b>). But I lost everything I had on that computer :( . Anyway, in high school, I found out, 
         much to my delight, that <b>Blender</b> had a pretty neat path tracer!
        </p>

            <h3>and then there's this bad horror movie</h3>
         <p>I made this for a competition for 2-minute horror shorts, filmed with a smartphone. 
         It's not very good, it's not very tasteful (WARNING: it does have a <b>pretty bad and gratuitous depiction of suicide</b>).
         Nevertheless, it really was a lot of fun to do, and to mess around with prosthethics and fake blood.
