    <h1>stuff i've made</h1>
    Here's a few things I've made along the way. Some of them are personal projects, some are things-that-were-used-by-actual-people, 
    and others are project courses where I went above and beyond (and a bit outside the scope) of what was needed.
     Source is available for all of them, so feel free to check it out!

            <p>This is a little experiment I'm making, comparing the performance of C++ and Rust by writing a toy pathtracer in both languages.</p>
            <p>So far, I've found that it's more natural to write higher performance code in Rust. Using similar constructs, and writing basic textbok code,
            I've found that the code in Rust runs ~50-100% faster. I'm looking forward to keep working on this project, and I'm really curious 
            to see what happens as I turn this into a fully fledged (bidirectional) pathtracer. Here's the <a>C++ version</a> and the <a>Rust version</a>.

            <p>
                Since we had free reign over the project, (i.e.: do anything that can be described by an ordinary differential equation), I chose to do something 
                a little more complicated and implement a simple mass-spring cloth simulation, with a few collision primitives, and tested it for (almost) all integrators covered in the lecture 
                (which was really easy to do since I implemented the proper abstractions). You may find the code <a href="">here</a>, as well as a short report <a href="">here</a>.

            <a href="">Margarida Ferreira</a>.
            It allowed students to create their own instances of Ricochet Robots, to play the game, save the solutions and playback
            any solution. Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/drcd1/Ricochet-Robots-Viewer">here</a>,

            I thought it was time to try and contribute with something a little more ambitious, so I did an implementation of

            It truly was a pleasant surprise to see the results from what is effectively the simplest "optimization" algorithm.

            (soft-shadows, glossy reflections, etc...), but we decided to implement a full pathtracer with support for HRD environment maps, 
            normal maps, physically based shading, and bokeh depth of field, among other things. <a>Code</a> and <a>Video</a>

            This is a software rasterizer and renderer that I did to learn the basics of Computer Graphics, before I had ever seen a graphics API in my life.
            It's not very fast, but it has a few elegantly designed abstractions. It did at some point support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_volume">shadow volumes</a> 
            (which is probably my favorite tech in real time rendering), but it was buggy and slow, so they are not there anymore.

            After I finished my first Programming course, I became aware of my love for Computer Graphics 
            (which made me switch from Physics to Computer Science the next year). So naturally I used the tools I knew (cairo and gtk2) to
            create a simple renderer. It's not much, but it was really fun to do!

            This was the project for the first Programming course I took (and my first time programming in general!).
             Me and <a href=""> Diogo Valada</a> went above and beyond what was asked of us and instead of solving the problem of two 
             discs colliding analytically, we created a relatively* robust collision solver that works for many disks. Please do not look at the <a href="">code</a>.
