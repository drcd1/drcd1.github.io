    <h1>learning resources</h1>
    Here are a few interesting resources I picked up along the way, for those of you who wish to join me on my pilgrimage to learn Computer Graphics. 
    Hopefully in time I will extend this with my own notes, but for now, this'll have to do.

    <h2>starter's pack</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/"">Scratchapixel</a> contains one of the most concise but 
    comprehensive introduction to Computer Graphics that I know of. If you know absolutely nothing about graphics (or even if you know a 
    bit but would like some pointers), you should definitely start here.
    </p>    
    <p>
    Of course, reading stuff is usually not enough. At least, not for me. When getting started with a topic, what really helps me is getting my hands dirty,
    play around a bit and code some stuff or do some math. Maybe reinvent the wheel a little bit. 
    </p>



    <h2>offline rendering</h2>
    <p>
    <a href = "https://www.pbrt.org/">Physically Based Rendering</a>, by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob and Greg Humphreys is what I consider to be
    the fundamental book in Computer Graphics. Their principled approach to explaining every problem makes the book easy to read, 
    and their use of literate programming to create the book and the underlying render engine from one single source makes it so that the reader is never lost.
    Overall, an absolutely flawless book. And the 3rd Edition is available on their website, for free!
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href = "https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/">Eric Veach's PhD Thesis</a> has also been something that I consulted time and time
    again during the courses I took in my Master's. Again, a very thorough explanation of most of the key concepts in pathtracing.
    </p>
    <p>
    After learning the basics, <a href = "https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/publications/advances-in-mc-2020-siggraph-course.html">
        Advances in Monte Carlo rendering: The Legacy of Jaroslav Křivánek</a> is a course I strongly recommend going through, 
        as it basically covers the state of the art in Offline Rendering, as well as serving as a tribubte to one of its most prominent researchers.
    </p>
    
    <h2>real-time rendering</h2>
    <p>
    If you are familiar with the basics of rendering and shading (see resources above), then the biggest hurdle to overcome is probably
    getting things done on the GPU. The first thing to do is to get aquainted with graphics API. The way I did it (okay, technically I am 
    still doing it) was to learn WebGL first, then OpenGL, then WebGPU and finally Vulkan, in this order. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The Web API's are roughly equivalent to their native counterparts, but their simpler abstractions and ease to deploy make them more friendly to
    first time graphics programmers. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href= "https://webgl2fundamentals.org/">WebGL2 Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">Vulkan Tutorial</a>
    are probably the two most comprehensive tutorials, and both are highly recommended.
    </p>
    
    <a href= https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-renderer-design-explained>This explanation of Godot 3's rendering engine</a> is a great introduction to renderer design, and<
    <a href =http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html#clustered-shading>this blog post by Ángel Ortiz</a> has a pretty thorough overview of current designs for renderers,
        with much better references than I could provide.
    <h2>geometry processing</h2>
    (todo)
    <h2>physics simulation</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.104x+3T2018">This course on EdX by Prof. Eitan Grinspun and the Univeristy of Columbia</a>
    </p>
    <h2>animation</h2>
    <p>
    (todo);
