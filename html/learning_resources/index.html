    <h1>learning resources</h1>
    Here are a few interesting resources I picked up along the way, for those of you who wish to join me on my pilgrimage to learn Computer Graphics. 
    Hopefully in time I will extend this with my own notes, but for now, this'll have to do. Note: this is still a work in progress. 
    More content will be added, more succinct and relevant references will be given.

    <h2>starter's pack</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/"">Scratchapixel</a> contains one of the most concise but 
    comprehensive introduction to Computer Graphics that I know of. If you know absolutely nothing about graphics (or even if you know a 
    bit but would like some pointers), you should definitely start here.
    </p>    
    <p>
    Of course, reading stuff is usually not enough. At least, not for me. When getting started with a topic,
     I find it extremely useful to get my hands dirty, so to speak. Implementing things from scratch helps me iron out small details,
      and it is particularly helpful to see
     the things that I was sure I knew, but that in fact I did not.
    </p>
    <p>
        After reading a little bit about rendering, the very best thing I can think of to
        get you excited about graphics is the work of <a href= "https://iquilezles.org/">Inigo Quilez</a> 
        (here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/8--5LwHRhjk">sample</a>). His blog is one of the best educational resources for computer graphics, 
        and SDF rendering is just a lot of fun!
    </p>


    <h2>offline rendering</h2>
    <p>
    <a href = "https://www.pbrt.org/">Physically Based Rendering</a>, by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob and Greg Humphreys is what I consider to be
    the fundamental book in Computer Graphics. Their principled approach to explaining every problem makes the book easy to read, 
    and their use of literate programming to create the book and the underlying render engine from one single source makes it so that the reader is never lost.
    Overall, an absolutely flawless book. And the 3rd Edition is available on their website, for free!
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href = "https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/">Eric Veach's PhD Thesis</a> has also been something that I consulted time and time
    again during the courses I took in my Master's. Again, a very thorough explanation of most of the key concepts in path tracing.
    </p>
    <p>
    After learning the basics, <a href = "https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/publications/advances-in-mc-2020-siggraph-course.html">
        Advances in Monte Carlo rendering: The Legacy of Jaroslav Křivánek</a> is a course I strongly recommend going through, 
        as it basically covers the state of the art in Offline Rendering, as well as serving as a tribute to one of its most prominent researchers.
    </p>
    
    <h2>real-time rendering</h2>
    <p>
    If you are familiar with the basics of rendering and shading (see resources above), then the biggest hurdle to overcome is probably
    getting things done on the GPU. The first thing to do is to get acquainted with graphics API. The way I did it (okay, technically I am 
    still doing it) was to learn WebGL first, then OpenGL, then WebGPU and finally Vulkan, in this order. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The Web API's are roughly equivalent to their native counterparts, but their simpler abstractions and ease to deploy make them more friendly to
    first time graphics programmers. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href= "https://webgl2fundamentals.org/">WebGL2 Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">Vulkan Tutorial</a>
    are probably the two most comprehensive tutorials, and both are highly recommended.
    </p>
    
    <a href= https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-renderer-design-explained>This explanation of Godot 3's rendering engine</a> 
    is a great introduction to renderer design, and
    <a href =http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html#clustered-shading>this blog post by Ángel Ortiz</a> has a pretty thorough overview of current designs for renderers,
        with much better references than I could provide.

    <p>
        For more advanced stuff, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/">Real-Time Rendering</a>, 
        which is not a good book in the same way that <a href="https://www.pbrt.org/">PBRT</a> is a good book: it is not sufficient in and of itself.
        But if one uses it as an index to find papers to read, it becomes much more valuable.
    </p>
    <p>I can always recommend skimming through <a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/contributors>the three editions of GPU Gems</a>, and stopping 
        to read what you find interesting. Ditto with <a href=>Ray Tracing Gems</a>. <a href=http://gpupro.blogspot.com/>GPU Pro</a> 
        and <a href=http://gpuzen.blogspot.com/>GPU Zen</a> are also very good references, but ones that I haven't read enough yet.</p>
    <p>Finally, the best resource for learning all the new techniques in real-time rendering is probably 
        <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/">this series of SIGGRAPH courses, "Advances in Real-Time Rendering".</a>
    </p>
    <p> As for researchers whose output has greatly enriched my knowledge over the years, I can certainly recommend the
        works of <a href="http://www.iryoku.com/blog">Jorge Jimenez</a> and <a href="https://casual-effects.com/">Morgan McGuire</a></p>
    
    <h2>animation</h2>
    <p>
        If you've read this far and you already know a little bit about computer graphics, 
        you should already be at ease with coding basic transforms and manipulating vertex buffers.
    </p>
    <p>
        (TO BE CONTINUED: this section is particularly WIP)
    </p>
    <div id=intermission>
    <h3>short intermission</h3>
    <p>
    The following two fields of Computer Graphics have a lot in common with Computational Mechanics and Scientific Computing. 
    As such, at the very core lie two distinct (yet often related) problems: 
    How do we create the mathematical model that represents what we want (i.e.: a sculpting tool for smoothing 
    or a simulation of water being poured into a cup),
    and how do we discretize it so that our discrete computers can handle them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This does come with the slight disadvantage that these topics have been researched for much much longer. 
        It doesn't make them any less interesting, but it becomes harder to know where to start.
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>geometry processing</h2>
    <p>
    Unlike rendering, which is a subject where the foundations are less than half a century old, the realm of geometry processing has a much longer history,
 and as such it's hard to know where to start (or even where to end, given the vastness of the field).
    </p>   
 <p>
    University level courses on calculus and multi-variate calculus are a must, as they help establish some of the foundations on dealing with volumes and surfaces, and
    basic knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry">Riemannian geometry</a> and <a href="Calculus of variations">Calculus of variations</a> help.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mas-PUA3OvA&list=PL9_jI1bdZmz0hIrNCMQW1YmZysAiIYSSS">This course by Prof. Keenan Crane and Carnegie Mellon University</a> is probably 
    the best introduction to the topic, giving a very clear overview of the subject.
        
    <p>
    In fact, a look at <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/>the work done by Keenan Crane and his peers</a> provides a very good overview of the subject field, 
    with a variety of topics and papers that are all easy to read.
    </p>


    <h2>physics simulation</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.104x+3T2018">This course on EdX by Prof. Eitan Grinspun and the Univeristy of Columbia</a> is a 
    one of the best introductions to the field of physically based animation and simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most fun books to read on fluid simulation is <b>Jos Stam's The Art of Fluid Animation</b>. It has the advantage of being very funny and
        very easy to read (it requires little to no mathematical knowledge), while still teaching you the important concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
       After going through these two resources, one should be able to start reading more advanced stuff. One of the most interesting 
       things to read about are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshfree_methods">meshfree methods</a> 
       (and I'm also saying this because it complements the mesh-dependent methods that are so common in geometry processing).
       In particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_point_method">material point method</a> and its variants appear to 
       be the ones most used today.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for state of the art research in this topic, I think 
        <a href=https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/merging-and-splitting/>the work currently being done at the University of
    Utah</a> is very educational, and the works of <a href= "https://theorangeduck.com/page/publications">Daniel Holden</a> related to sub-space, data-driven physics are interesting as well.
    </p>
